      "mission": "Mexico Puebla South Mission",
      "storyText": "When I first opened my mission call and read the words 'Mexico Puebla South Mission,' I felt an overwhelming sense of peace. I didn’t know what to expect, but I trusted the Lord. My first companion taught me that success isn’t measured by baptisms but by obedience and love. One of the most inspiring moments was when a young boy we taught bore his testimony just one week after baptism. He said, 'I feel light inside.' That light changed me. Missions are not only about changing others, but letting the Lord change us. To every youth wondering if they’re ready—just trust Him. He will qualify you."

      "mission": "Peru Lima Central Mission",
      "storyText": "As a teenager, I never thought I’d serve a mission. I didn’t think I was strong enough spiritually. But after attending a youth conference, something changed. I felt a pull to prepare and serve. My mission in Lima tested me in every way. The streets were loud, the days long, and sometimes rejection stung. But one day we met a man who had lost his family and was searching for hope. We taught him about eternal families and the Plan of Salvation. He cried, and for the first time, I understood the sacredness of our message. That’s when I realized that missions are not about perfection—they’re about direction. To the youth preparing: the Lord doesn't need you to be perfect. He needs you to be willing."

      "mission": "New Zealand Wellington Mission",
      "storyText": "From the moment I arrived in New Zealand, I felt the love of the people. I was assigned to a small branch with many youth. One young girl named Moana reminded me of myself—shy, unsure, but full of potential. We invited her to help us teach a lesson. Her courage inspired me. As I bore my testimony beside hers, I realized how much my mission had changed me. I used to be afraid to speak up. But the mission gave me a voice, and more importantly, gave me a cause. I now encourage every young woman to trust that the Lord will help her grow into her calling. If He could mold me, He can mold anyone."

      "mission": "Dominican Republic Santo Domingo East Mission",
      "storyText": "Growing up in a tough neighborhood, I often felt like I wasn’t good enough to represent the Lord. But my mission changed everything. I served in a poor area where most people had very little, yet they gave so much. One day we were invited into a home with a leaking roof and no electricity. The family said, ‘We’ve been waiting for you.’ We taught them about Jesus Christ, and the Spirit filled that humble home. I learned that worthiness is about the direction of your heart, not your background. To all youth who think they’re not enough—God sees your future. Trust Him and take the step."

      "mission": "Utah Salt Lake City Mission",
      "storyText": "Some people think that serving in Utah is easy because there are already so many members. But the truth is, everyone needs the gospel. One of my most memorable experiences was teaching a woman who had been less active for decades. Her grandchildren were active, and she wanted to understand why they loved church so much. Through weekly visits and heartfelt prayers, she came back to church and later went to the temple. Seeing her return home spiritually made me realize that every soul matters. Missions aren’t just about finding new people—they’re about helping all return to Christ."

      "mission": "Brazil São Paulo West Mission",
      "storyText": "As a native Portuguese speaker, I thought my mission would be easy. But even in my own country, I faced doubts and rejection. One day, we taught a young man who reminded me of myself before I joined the Church. His questions made me reflect deeply on why I believe. As I bore testimony of Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon, I felt the Spirit confirm it again. That moment renewed my purpose. Missions aren’t about proving something—they’re about witnessing truth. Youth, remember: if God called you, He will qualify you."

      "mission": "France Paris Mission",
      "storyText": "France is beautiful, but teaching the gospel in a secular culture has its challenges. People often asked, ‘Why do you believe in God?’ I had to learn to testify with clarity and conviction. One woman told me, ‘You remind me of hope.’ That sentence changed me. I realized that even small acts of faith leave eternal marks. To the youth: don’t be afraid to be a light. Missions teach you that even in hard soil, seeds of faith can grow."

      "mission": "Spain Madrid Mission",
      "storyText": "Before my mission, I struggled with my own testimony. But I decided to go anyway, hoping to find answers. In Spain, I found a deep love for the scriptures. I remember one night studying Mosiah 2 with a recent convert. As we read together, he said, ‘This is the first time I’ve felt real peace in years.’ That moment felt sacred. Through teaching others, I discovered my own faith. If you're unsure, go anyway. The mission will give you what you didn’t even know you needed."

      "mission": "Alaska Anchorage Mission",
      "storyText": "My mission in Alaska was cold, dark at times, and lonely. But in those quiet, frozen moments, I learned to hear the whisperings of the Spirit. We taught a woman who lived in a cabin and had never heard of the Church. She said she had always believed something more was out there. As we taught her, I saw light come into her eyes. She was baptized in a lake, surrounded by snow. It was like watching a miracle. Youth, know this: the Lord will send you where He needs you—and He will walk beside you."

      "storyText": "As a teenager, I loved video games and had never really shared the gospel. On my mission, I had to learn how to talk to strangers, study deeply, and rely on prayer. I remember feeling inadequate. But little by little, I changed. One day, a man approached us and said, ‘You look like people who know peace. Can you help me find it?’ That question changed everything. We taught him, and he was later baptized. Youth preparing to serve—if you feel afraid, that’s okay. What matters is that you take the step. God will walk with you."

      "storyText": "Serving in the Philippines taught me humility and resilience. The people welcomed us with open arms, even when they had so little. One day, we helped rebuild a member's home destroyed by a typhoon. Afterward, we taught their neighbors about the Plan of Salvation. Many of them accepted the gospel and joined the Church. I learned that true service opens hearts. Missions teach you that blessings often come after sacrifice and storms."

      "mission": "South Korea Seoul Mission",
      "storyText": "Being Korean-American, I thought I would blend right in. But I still had to adjust culturally and spiritually. I was humbled when I realized I wasn’t just there to teach—I was there to learn. One of our investigators was an y woman who had lost her faith. Through patient visits and loving service, she began to trust us. Eventually, she told us she felt God's love again. That was my mission’s purpose—to help people remember that God never forgets them."

      "mission": "Argentina Mendoza Mission",
      "storyText": "In Argentina, we walked miles every day under the sun, but my heart was always full. I’ll never forget teaching a family who had been praying for guidance. As we shared the First Vision, the father said, 'This is what I’ve been searching for my whole life.' That moment made every sore foot worth it. Missions show you that people are prepared—you just have to find them and speak with faith."

      "mission": "Canada Vancouver Mission",
      "storyText": "Canada was full of diversity and deep spiritual hunger. We met a young refugee woman who had never heard of Jesus Christ. Teaching her about His life and Atonement felt sacred. When she prayed for the first time, the Spirit was so strong we all cried. She later told us, 'Now I know I’m not alone.' The mission taught me the power of introducing someone to their Savior for the first time."

      "mission": "Chile Santiago East Mission",
      "storyText": "At the start of my mission, I was quiet and unsure. I had to learn to speak up and share my heart. One day, a less-active member asked, 'Why do you do this every day?' I bore testimony of the joy I found in Christ, and for the first time, my words felt powerful. That man returned to church and even started preparing for a mission. Missions don’t just change others—they shape you into who God needs you to be."

      "storyText": "Italy taught me that the gospel speaks every language. We met a woman from Nigeria who didn’t speak Italian well, but she felt the Spirit through music. We began using hymns in our lessons, and her faith blossomed. She was baptized and later called to lead music in Relief Society. The mission helped me see that love and the Spirit are universal languages."

      "mission": "Germany Berlin Mission",
      "storyText": "Sharing the gospel in a place with deep historical roots was awe-inspiring. Many people were hesitant to talk about religion, but we found ways to connect through service. One older man we helped in his garden later invited us to teach his family. The gospel softened hearts that had been closed for years. I learned that patience and consistency open doors—and lives."

      "mission": "Japan Tokyo Mission",
      "storyText": "Japan taught me quiet strength. Many people were polite but reserved. It took months to build trust. One young college student came to English class every week and asked deep questions about life. Over time, she accepted the gospel and was baptized. At her confirmation, she smiled and said, 'Now I have a purpose.' Her journey helped me realize that quiet faith can be deeply powerful."

One of my favorite memories was baptizing a man who had once been a preacher. He said, 'Now I know what Christ really wants me to do.' It reminded me that no one is beyond the reach of truth. My mission deepened my faith and my desire to serve forever."

      "mission": "Scotland/Ireland Mission",
      "storyText": "Scotland was cold, wet, and beautiful. The people were direct and thoughtful. One woman we taught was fiercely independent and hesitant. But as we continued to meet and pray with her, she opened up. She said, 'You’ve reminded me of who I am.' She was baptized and later shared her testimony with her whole family. The mission helped me realize that even the most guarded hearts can feel God's love when approached with kindness and truth."
